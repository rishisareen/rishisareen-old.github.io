In the [previous post](nutrition-a-primer.html), we covered the basics about Nutrition.

Today we will dig deeper into Carbs, and particularly sugar.

## Blood Sugar 
You must be aware of Blood Fasting Test.
Normal non-diabetes Fasting blood sugar is **70-100mg/dl**.

Let us use this range, and do some basic maths now.

- Blood Volume in Average Adult = 5L  
- Blood Sugar Lower Range = 700mg / lt x 5L = 3500mg, or 3.5gm  
- Blood Sugar Upper Range = 1000mg / lt x 5L = 5000mg, or 5gm  

Human has average blood sugar of 3.5-5gm. That is ONE teaspoon of sugar. **In the entire blood stream.**

Anything more than this is toxic.

## The Role of Insulin
Luckily, human body has evolved to handle such conditions.

When we eat Sugar (in direct form or Simple Carbs), our body gets into action:

- Enzymes in the small intestine break it down into glucose.  
- Our pancreas are closely monitoring blood sugar level. When it goes beyond the safe range, insulin is released to control it.  
- Insulin can store the excess sugar in fat cells, for future usage.

**Insulin Resistance (IR):** Over time, chronic daily insults and stress on the pancreas to produce insulin several times a day eventually insulin resistance will develop. Now when cells become insulin resistant metabolic syndrome of one sort or another begin to develop. This is the onset of diabetes.

## Carboydrates == Sugar  
Most health conscious people know sugar is “BAD”. However, we do not realize easily digestible carbohydrates breakdown into **SUGAR** in your bloodstream!   
This includes rice, whole-grains,  potatoes, many fruits, some nuts, beans/legumes and other foods people commonly believe are healthy and should be eaten in abundance.
