### Sports and Caffeine

These are my notes on how caffeine works and how it can be used to enhance sports performance. I will keep on updating as I learn more. 



**The Inner Workings of Caffeine**

* Think of your brain like a castle with tiny locks on its walls, and  adenosine is the key that makes you feel tired and sleepy. But caffeine  plays the role of a vigilant guard that prevents these adenosine keys  from working. When caffeine takes over, you feel wide awake, and your  brain functions at its best.

* This "guarding" action of caffeine leads to improved alertness, better  focus, quicker reactions, and an overall boost in how well your brain  works.

* As a central nervous system stimulant, caffeine reduces the perception  of effort during physical activities. This is reflected in a lower Rate  of Perceived Exertion (RPE)

* Caffeine's impact on physical performance extends to various metrics including time-to-exhaustion, time-trial performance, muscle strength and endurance, as well as high-intensity sprints often encountered in team sports.

* (Science Insights: Caffeine works its magic by mimicking adenosine, fooling the brain into thinking it's the same key. When caffeine enters the brain, it attaches to the adenosine locks and prevents them from working. This slowdown in brain activity triggers your body to make more adrenaline, like a superhero booster. That's why you feel super alert for about four to six hours until the caffeine wears off.)

**Recommended Dosage**

- Notably, improvements in physical performance tend to become evident when caffeine is consumed in doses surpassing approximately 200mg (equivalent to around 3mg per kg of body weight).
- Recommended Dosage: 3 to 6 mg per kg of body weight
- **Notes:**
  - Caffeine has half life of 5 hours and it takes one hour to reach its peak impact
  - Food intake also impacts the absorption of caffeine. Best response is fasted state. To be experimented individually.
  - Best source of caffeine is caffeine pills. Coffee is not a good source if one wants precision. The amount of caffeine in coffee depends a lot on beans, roasting mechanism (light roast has more caffeine compared to dark roast), brewing method. 




**How to take during the race**

* Approach 1 : Take full dosage (mega dosage - 6mg per body weight) before the race. For full ironman, renew it after 6 hours.
* Approach 2 : Take full dosage when needed. Eg, if bike is the struggle, take full dosage in the bike leg.
* Approach 3: Take micro dosage throughout the race, 50-75mg per hour.
* Approach 4 :  (My preferred)
  * Take Full Dosage (300mg - 400mg (4-6)x BW) after bike start
  * Take half dosage (100mg 1.5x ) every two hour
  * Advantage : Not taking too early will avoid going too hard in the start.
