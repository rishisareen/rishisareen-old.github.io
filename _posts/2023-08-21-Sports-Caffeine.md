### Sports and Caffeine

These are my notes on how caffeine works and how it can be used to enhance sports performance. I will keep on updating as I learn more. 



**How Caffeine works**

* Imagine your brain has tiny locks called receptors. Adenosine is like a  key that fits into these locks and makes you feel tired. Caffeine is like a guard that stops the adenosine keys from working. When caffeine guards the locks, you feel more awake and your brain works better.
* This inhibition leads to enhanced alertness, vigilance, attention, reaction time, and overall cognitive function.
* As a central nervous system stimulant, caffeine reduces the perception  of effort during physical activities. This is reflected in a lower Rate  of Perceived Exertion (RPE). 
* Caffeine's impact on physical performance extends to various metrics including time-to-exhaustion, time-trial performance, muscle strength and endurance, as well as high-intensity sprints often encountered in team sports.
* Notably, improvements in physical performance tend to become evident when caffeine is consumed in doses surpassing approximately 200mg (equivalent to around 3mg per kg of body weight).
* (Science Notes: Caffeine alters the activity of these receptors, largely because of its  close resemblance to adenosine. Once caffeine enters the brain, it is  recognized by brain receptors as adenosine, and is able to bind to the  adenosine receptors. Through this process, caffeine essentially stops  adenosine from locking into the brain’s receptors and slows down nerve  cell activity. In turn, the sudden increase in brain activity triggers  the adrenal glands to produce more adrenaline. As a result, caffeine  produces a feeling of alertness that usually lasts from four to six  hours — until the caffeine is metabolized.)

**Recommended Dosage**

- 3 to 6 mg per kg of body weight
- Caffeine has half life of 5 hours and it takes one hour to reach its peak impact
- Note: Food intake also impacts the absorption of caffeine. Best response is fasted state. To be experimented individually.
- Note: Best source of caffeine is caffeine pills. Coffee is not a good source if one wants precision. The amount of caffeine in coffee depends a lot on beans, roasting mechanism (light roast has more caffeine compared to dark roast), brewing method. 



**How to take during the race**

* Approach 1 : Take full dosage (mega dosage - 6mg per body weight) before the race. For full ironman, renew it after 6 hours.
* Approach 2 : Take full dosage when needed. Eg, if bike is the struggle, take full dosage in the bike leg.
* Approach 3: Take micro dosage throughout the race, 50-75mg per hour.
* Approach 4 :  (My preferred)
  * Take Full Dosage (300mg - 400mg (4-6)x BW) after bike start
  * Take half dosage (100mg 1.5x ) every two hour
  * Advantage : Not taking too early will avoid going too hard in the start.
