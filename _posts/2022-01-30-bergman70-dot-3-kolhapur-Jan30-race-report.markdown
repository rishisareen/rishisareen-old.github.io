### Covid and Race Preparation

This is a race which took 2 years to happen. 

Kolhapur Tri was originally scheduled for Oct 2020. When registration opened in March ‘20, I signed up immediately. This is a local race with growing reputation. I was keen to try this out. Covid was more a potential threat then, no one knew then that everything will change. 

As Covid took the entire world in its grip, all events got either cancelled or postponed. There was no race in 2021 or 2021. For me, this was first race after [Goa 70.3](https://rishisareen.com/triathlon/race%20reports/ironman70-dot-3-goa-oct-19-race-report.html), which was way back in October of 2019.

Now on the training front, I still managed to stay consistent. WFH allowed to save on the commute time, which gave more time for the training. 

**Bike** :  With frequent lockdowns and restrictions, I took my bike training indoors. While it was born out of necessity, I discovered it [amplifies the progress](https://rishisareen.com/triathlon/cycling/indoortraining-gettingstarted.html). All you need is [a good trainer](https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/indoor-cycling/bike-trainers/kickr-core-buy) and a good training plan.

I am part of [Purple Patch Triathlon Squad](https://www.purplepatchfitness.com/). Their Bike Training Programs and online video sessions are amazing. MD (As head coach Matt Dixon is called) leads the Video session. He mix various skills - Efficient Pedalling Techniques / Hill Climb / High Cadence Work / Low Cadence work / Threshold work. So, despite no outdoor riding in last 2 years, I’ve improved as cyclist. 

**Run:** Running was a mixed bag. Good part is I stayed consistent. But with no race in the sight, I didn’t push too hard in the run. So, progress has been slow. I had low running mileage. Harsh Delhi Winters and Severe pollution limited outdoor time. 

**Swim:** I live in Delhi. Here, for most of last 2 years, we had no access to the pools. In winters, pools remain shut anyway. And in summers, frequent lockdowns limited the pool access. Going into Bergman Tri, I had almost nil Swim practice. The blame is not only on the infra. I’ve my share of responsibility. I have swim band. I need to use more of it when I don't have pool access. 

It was Friday morning (7th Jan), 3 weeks before the race, when I woke up with bad fatigue and cough. RT-PCR confirmed the doubt - Covid Positive!! I had no option but to halt the training and rest. Thankfully, I recovered in a week’s time. 



### Race Strategy

With all these aspects, my Race Strategy for Kolhapur was - Survive the Swim, Go Hard on the Bike and on the Run. Swim - 60”, Bike: 2:50, Run : 1:55 was what I was aiming for. 

For Nutrition, it was time to experiment. My plan was to aim for ~300 calories per hour and proper electrolytes. This time I wanted to push a bit of aggressive carb consumption and observe the body reaction. SiS Caffeine Gels was going to be my main fuel.  Each SiS Gel has 22gm of Carbs + 150mg of Caffeine. So 2 gels + snickers would give me close to 300 carbs per hour.



### Pre-Race Days

#### The Uncertainty

In October 2021, organizers of Kolhapur Tri revised the Race Date to 30th Jan ‘22. Then Covid Third wave started. All facilities were shut down again, all races got moved. 

For Kolhapur Tri, Organizers were working. Constant updates were being sent - discussions on with the race authorities. 

Finally, on 19th Jan morning, 11 days before the scheduled race, Vaibhav confirmed - RACE IS ON!! They got go ahead!! Wow!! Lot of strings must have been pulled to make this happen. 



#### New Bike Bag and Packing Struggle

Wasting no time, I booked my flight to Pune for 27th Jan.

I kept entire 26th Jan for the packing. Any triathlete will tell you, Race packing is itself a big task. First you’ve to pack for 3 disciplines - Swim, Bike and Run. Bike itself is a big task, as it has to be taken on the flight. I had bought a new compact cycling bag - [Orucase B2](https://www.orucase.com/products/b2). Made for convenient airport and city transfer of the bike, it is an amazing compact bag. But this compactness comes with a cost - cycle needs to be unassembled completely. And 26th Jan being National Holiday, all shops were closed. Thankfully, YouTube came to the rescue and I managed to get it done.



#### Delhi, Pune, Kolhapur

Delhi to Pune Flight was uneventful. It was AirIndia flight. Incidentally, 27th Jan was the first day Tata took handover of AirIndia. There was a bit of chaos at the check-in counter, but nothing major. 

Orucase proved to be a great choice as bike bag. The bag is very compact and it has small wheels. It was very easy to handle as solo traveller. And there is lot of cushion in the bag, so it keeps frame and other components safe. No doubt, this bag will see lot of races with me in upcoming months.  

Reaching Pune, Sujoy and Alok picked me to Airport and dropped me at Maitreyi’s place.  27th was spent getting bike assembled, doing a small swim in freezing Law School Swimming pool

On 28th Morning, From Pune, we drove to Kolhapur. Pune is connected to Kolhapur by National Highway. It is 240km, smooth highway. Took about 3.5 hours to reach.



#### One Day before the Race

On 29th Morning, we went for Practice Swim. [Rajaram Talav](https://goo.gl/maps/fxMoTsvV8pLdeZ3G8) is the Swim venue for the race and Expo / T1 / T2 were all on the short climb side of the lake. 

As it was first open water swim after 2 years, I grabbed a swim buoy and entered water. From the first stroke, it felt comfortable. Water was cold but comfortable. I felt no panic, no cold water shock. I did a nice easy 200m round of the lake and came out. Till this time, I was undecided if wetsuit is needed or not. After this swim, (which was without wetsuit), I decided - No Wetsuit needed! 

Swim done, we got the bike out from the car, did a 5” ride to confirm brakes and everything is ok. it was.  As Expo and Bike Check-in was open, we decided to check-in the bikes. 

The expo was nice. Bike Mechanic was available, and there were stalls from Garmin, On the Run Nutrition Bars, another stall where you could purchase Swim Buoys. We quickly got Race Bib and bag. The bag is very nice and sturdy. From the check-in counter, we moved to bike area (it is all in same place) and racked our bike.

Overall expo was very nicely organized. Only disappointment was no Covid Protocols were followed anywhere  - No checking of RT-PCR, People roaming without Masks, No checks if only athletes are going. None of the guidelines mentioned in the Race Guide were enforced.  

Evening was spent chilling - relaxing with friends over small drink and lot of good food.

#### Race Morning

I prefer my race morning to be calm and organized. Everything was packed the night before. 

Waking up at 4:45 am, I freshen up and had light breakfast - one banana, energy bar and caffeine pill. 

After reaching the race venue, I went through the usual checklist:

* Filled Air in Tyres. Kept to 100 psi.
* Fixed Water Bottle. I was carrying 2 water bottles, each with Gatorade + Salt
* Mounted Garmin Cyclocomputer on the bike
* Arranged stuff for Bike and Run Transitions.  

All done, clicked some selfies with the friends.

### Swim [1.9km]

Swim line-up was at 6:30am with race start at 6:45am. 

{% include image.html file="/images/2022_01_30_KolhapurTri/20220130_KolhapurTri_Swim01.JPEG" description="20220130_KolhapurTri_Swim01" %}



At 6:30am, speaker voice alerted us to gather at the bank of the lake. We quickly lined up. Organizers briefed us again about the swim loop. The swim loop was L shape - go 350m straight, right turn for 600m and then come back the same path. 

Briefing done, we waited for 5” for first rays of sunlight to hit the lake. That moment was very serene. I was calm. I took the swim buoy as precaution as no open water swim for 2 years. . 

{% include image.html file="/images/2022_01_30_KolhapurTri/20220130_KolhapurTri_Swim04 (The course).JPEG" description="20220130_KolhapurTri_Swim04 (The course)" %} 

Swim start was little rough - about 30 people swimming together. I quickly realized that swim buoy was not a dumb idea. First of all, It was slowing me down. And then there were ropes laid all through the route, which was a good measure. So, swim buoy was not  needed. But anyway, too late in the game. It was not even my own swim buoy but borrowed from a friend. Otherwise I would have unlatched it and continued with out it. 

Swimming comfortably, I reached the 900m loop. I checked the time elapsed - 36 min. DAMN!!! I knew I was slow, but not this slow!!! Calculating, I realized I was in serious risk to miss the swim cutoff of 70 min. My race would have been over even before I reached the bike.

I decided to accelerate the return leg. Good thing is I was feeling calm and swim form was coming back a bit. The return loop was done in 31 min, overall swim in in 67 min. Phew!!! I made it just 3 min before the cutoff.  

Other than almost missing the cutoff, I was happy the way swim felt. No fatigue, no panic.

Total Time: 67min
Total Swim done: 1800m

Nutrition: Nothing

### T1

Coming out from the swim, I saw Rohan. He was waiting for me, as I was the last person out. It was so good to see a familiar face. 

T1 was about 400m walk up the hill from swim exit . I dashed to T1, wore HRM, Helmet, Cycling Gloves, Socks, Shoes. All ready, All done, I inserted one newspaper inside Zipper top. The paper helps to absorb the water and moisture. All done, I inserted 6 Gels in the back pocket, unracked cycle and walked towards the exit which was 100m away. You’re not allowed to mount the cycle before that. 

Total Time: 8 min

### Cycle [90km]

The bike route is single out and back loop on the National Highway 48, Maharashtra Goa Route. It is a rolling terrain, with km 42 to 45 being at 5-8% gradient. . The U-Turn is at Km 45. 

After I came out T1, it was 1km sharp downhill and uphill ride to reach highway.  Touching highway, I settled down in an easy comfortable rhythm. Now it was all about executing a solid bike ride. Something I had trained for well.

Reaching Highway, I watchfully merged into the main traffic. There were volunteers at the merging point, which was extremely helpful. Now, when I touched highway, I settled down, focused on breathing easy and establishing good cadence. All settled, it was time for hydration. I’ve back cage holder, which keeps 2 water bottles. 

In a practiced motion, I moved right hand behind my back to grip the bottle. Eyes remained focused on the road. The hand moved in air, no bottle came in contact. I glanced back -  no water bottle on the right side!! What!!!! Shocked, I realized one bottle was gone. Anxiously, I checked left side. Nope, no bottle there too.

**Damn, damn, DAMN!!!!**

Before going to swim, I clearly remembered filling and racking the bottles. No idea what happened to the bottle. I was stunned here!

Going down on the aero position, I took deep breaths, calmed my mind and assessed the situation. 

In long distance course, Nutrition plays a very key role. As the day is long, you need to fuel and hydrate yourself constantly. And bike is the best time to get some calories in. When you hit the run, your stomach can’t handle much calories.

I had 6 gels, so about 2 gels an hour. Good. This would give me 44 gm of carbs. I was also carrying snickers, so another 10gm of carbs an hour. While not enough, it was not bad. It would take care of my fuel. But I also needed to hydrate. And hydration is more than just plan water. Body loses lot of sweat in the race. To replenish that, electrolytes are needed. An ideal combination is mix of Sodium / Magnesium / Potassium and Calcium. But plain salt would also do, sodium is often most lacking. 

Continuing pedalling, I took the first gel. I was slowly overtaking people. The first aid station came at 12km mark. I got 200ml Bisleri there, and NO SALT was available!!  Even on all other aid station, it was all water / fast n up and banana on one. No salt. This is something that organizers must fix for the future. Salt is essential for long distance races. Yes, I should have kept a backup. But this is a supported race, there should be salt on the aid station. 

Anyway, I focused on task at hand and maintained a steady 30-32 kmph pace. The Km 42 to 45 were expectedly very steep and challenging. I kept an eye on the power meter here, idea is not to go too hard on this and suffer later. 

My Cycling FTP is 229 watts. I was racing with 170-190 watts as my target race power. For these inclines, I went till 200-210w but nothing beyond that. Thanks to all the low RPM work MD made me do, I was able to push through the long climb.

After 45km turn, it was time to take benefit of all the climb. I tucked myself in the drop bar, and I went speedy. Next 5km came in under 8 min, av speed of 38kmph with top speed of 60.8 kmph. What a rush!

The bike was overall well executed. First 30km came in 60min. Second in 64min, and third took 61min. My Normalized power was 166w. Last 20km I faded a bit, the heat was on and I started to feel the dehydration impact. 

Total Time: 3hr 5min

Elevation: 804m

Nutrition: 2 Gels every hour + 1 snicker every hour. Small banana twice on the course.

### T2

Reaching transition area, I racked the bike, rushed behind the transition area to pee. Now, this was another struggle with single piece tri suit. Noted for the future.

After relieving, I changed into my running Vibrams, grabbed running cap, stuffed 4 gels in back pocket, had 2 salt tablets with Gatorade.

Total Time: 7 min

Nutrition: 2 Salt Tabs + Gatorade

### Run [21.1km]

It was close to noon when I started the run. First thing I noticed was the heat. Temperature was 30 degrees and rising. For me personally, coming from peak delhi winters, this was quite a change. 

The Run Route was out and back loop of 5.5k. So, 4 loops were to be done. Timing mat was there on both end of road. 

The route was rolling, with decent elevation of 175m over the half marathon. 

I started off well. First 5k came just in 29 minutes. Easy and comfortable pace. I was surprised at the elevation though. Running on Delhi flat roads, any small elevation is a challenge.

By the time next loop started, body had started to slow down. I still maintained pace of 6. But the Rate of Perceived Exertion was extremely high.  Heat on the run course, dehydration from the bike, elevation - everything was making me struggle. 

This is where things turned dark. My mind decided this misery was not worth it. All pessimist, dark thoughts came running in my mind. I was cursing my life choices of this sport :joy:

Now, endurance sports is a game of managing pain. Everyone goes through the dark phase. It is inevitable, part of the deal. I’ve done many long distance triathlons - 2 full ironman and 7 half iron distances. So I know this phase. But I was not prepared at how strong it was this time. I wanted to quit at 8 km mark itself. This has never happened to me, not even in Full Ironman where I’ve struggled. 

It was all downhill from there. My mind was complaining about every single thing - the heat, the hot road causing blisters with thin vibrams sole, the fatigue. Every km I wanted to quit. I somehow managed to continue running, with very uneven splits and walking every few minutes. 

The volunteers were lovely though, cheering, offering food, salt, ice sponges. I used all of the, but not much benefit happened.

Managed to finish the run in 2 hours 34 min, badly fatigued / in pain / disappointed.

Pace split

- 0 - 5k : 29 min

- 5 - 10k : 30 min

- 10 - 15k : 36 min

- 15 - 20k : 44 min
- 20 - 21.5 k : 15 min

End time: 2hr 34 min

Nutrition: 4 gels + coke every aid station 

Total Time: 7 hr 4 min

## Post Race

Crawling through the finish line, I met my friends. They must be wondering why I am looking like shit :laughing:. We clicked some pics and then I just went aside for few minutes. 

Just few weeks back, I had a local race, where I ran 20k in 1 hour 38 min. So, I was not in a bad running shape. I was just not ready to struggle this much. I introspected later what went wrong. During that time, I was just angry at myself and frustrated.

After resting for a while, drinking Gatorade and popping salt tablets. I recovered and went back to the gathering area.

Here, I learnt that Maitreyi got podium - second fastest female of the day!! So, at least some cheer on a dark day!!!! 

{% include image.html file="/images/2022_01_30_KolhapurTri/20220130_KolhapurTri_PostRace (With Maitreyi).JPEG" description="20220130_KolhapurTri_PostRace (With Maitreyi)" %}



Later news came Sonia also got podium in her Age Group category. DG was almost at Sub 6, that was a solid performance after Jet lag. Sujoy being Sujoy was happy on finishing and solid bike with zero training (the dude was not doing this race till 2 days before the race!)

So, all this news helped to cheer up a bit. While my race personally was disaster (we will call it learning experience :laughing:), it was wonderful to learn that my friends got good race. 

Going back to the hotel, I made loads of notes on what went wrong. While I was down and out, there was no way I was not going to capture this. 



### Looking Back

Now, while I am writing this after a week, where things have settled down, there are some very clear learnings. 



#### Learnings

* Train for the course: I was not prepared for the heat or the elevation on the run. 
* Backup plan for the hydration : All my salt capsules were in the bottle. When bottles were lost, I had no salt. In endurance race, electrolytes are super important. Need to have a plan B
* Fix Bike Hydration Arrangement: Need to get more sturdy bottle cage
* Need to put in lot more hours in swim. I finished the swim 3 min before the cutoff. I am not that bad a swimmer. But consistency is the key.
* Fuelling strategy: I tried SiS gels for the first time in the race. Each Gel has 150mg of Caffeine. That is a lot of caffeine. I suspect it also didn’t go completely well and increased RPE. Need to understand a bit more on this.



It was not all dark and bad. There were some aspects which went well

#### What went well

* No fear of open water. (Write about “one with the ocean”)
* Solid Bike
* Could maintain aero
* Run form didn’t drop



Till next race, then!
