## What am I doing
- Meditation: Restarted, after previous experiment failed. New approach [here](http://rishisareen.com/habits/habit-forming-50-first-dates-report.html)
- 7 min workout: Trigger: After Brush. 52 days so far without any skip day, getting easy.

## What am I reading
- [Mindless eating - why we eat more than we think](http://www.amazon.com/Mindless-Eating-More-Than-Think/dp/0345526880). Very interesting insight on how we end up overeating.

## A quote that's on my mind
- _Anyone can want a gold medal. Few people want to train like an Olympian._

## What am I learning
- Exploring Octopress blogging framework, mainly if I should move to Octopress 3.0. Need to study the reward/risk benefit
