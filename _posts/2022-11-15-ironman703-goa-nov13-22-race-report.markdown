### Race Build Up
My last race was [Ironman Italy](https://rishisareen.com/triathlon/race%20reports/ironman-italy-sept-22-race-report.html) in Sept '22. 

After a week of rest post the race, I started 7 weeks build for Goa. 

Training went good. 

**Swim :** Biggest improvement area. After the IM Italy disastrous swim (~2 hours to finish the swim), I was cautious. 

For Goa 70.3, training was all in the pool. With limited time at hand, my main focus was improving my pull. In swimming, 90% of forward motion in is from the pull. So, with tips from excellent book "Swim Speed Secrets" of Sheila Taormina, my prime focus was pull. 

**Bike :**  All the bike work were indoors. The workouts were intense and I loved it. In this training block, my FTP increased from 229w to 246w. Due to Delhi pollution, I could not do outdoor ride. 

**Run :**  The run volume was not as much as I would have liked. It was average 30km a week.  

I also got carbon wheels before the race. It was a leap of faith to race with them with zero practice on them. But as I was treating Goa 70.3 as my 'B' race, this was the right time to experiment. 

### Race Strategy
There has been a mindset shift since Ironman Italy 2022. I have no timing pressure and I am determined to enjoy the training and the race. 

For this race, My strategy was :

- Swim : Enjoy the swim, be less scared and focus on finishing fast. I get scared of going hard in the water, elevating my heart rate and not knowing how to rest to bring it down. I practiced this in pool (pushing hard in pool and slowing down) and it helped.

- Bike : I'm happy with my bike. Strategy was to push as per power meter and to stay in Zone 3. 

- Run : Run in Goa 70.3 is always in very hot and humid conditions. I've experienced this in 2019 edition too. Strategy was to use ice at aid station as much as I can and keep the core body temperature low. 

  


### Race Day

Race start was 7am, with transition area closing at 6:50am.

I managed to sleep good for 5 hours and woke up at 4:30am. Breakfast was energy bar, cookies and chocolate in the room, as there was no breakfast in the hotel. 

From hotel, we walked down to the transition area, 50m away. It was a long line at the start, it took us good 20 min to enter the transition. 

Reaching the transition area, i checked cycle and filled the air, fixed the bottles and laid down stuff for T1 and T2. As no transition bags were given, we laid down the stuff on the ground. I kept it on a towel and arranged as per T1 and T2.



### Swim [1.9km]

Moving out of the transition, I gave street wear bag at the drop counter. 

The swim start was delayed by 45 min, as organizers were waiting for Chief Minister to arrive and flag it off. I was mentally calculating that this 45" delay will bother us in the run. 

Swim was a staggered start, with 7 athletes going in water every 5 seconds. I opted for 40-50 min queue.  Maitreyi and Rohin were also there with me. 

Entering the water, I adjusted my swim goggles and started to swim. It felt good, water was calm. Initially I tried to swim close to rope but gave up soon as lot of beginners hanging on to the dear rope and kicking.

The first loop (1000m) finished in 26 min. It was Australian exit, so we came out of the water, ran around the mat and entered the water again.

In the second loop, the water current direction favored our swim as lot of tailwind drift was there. Keeping away from incoming swimmer traffic, I swam strong and finished second loop in 20 min. 

This was probably the best swim I had in any race (and swim PR too). It was comfortable and I was strong. A huge confidence booster, after what happened in Ironman Italy.

Total Time: 46 min

Total Swim done: 1800m (as per my Garmin)

**Nutrition**: Nothing. It was deliberate as I've observed bloating / burps if I eat anything before the swim. Good  decision.

### T1
The transition was a long one. I jogged / walked to the transition, reaching in 2 min. I was wearing tri-suit. Here I made a rookie mistake of trying to put on heart rate monitor. In a clumsy manner, I tried removing a wet tri-suit enough to put the HRM. That didn't work. Then I searched for a volunteer to help me with this. Couldn't find one. 

After wasting a total of 3 min in this, I gave up. 

Wore helmet, goggles, gloves, socks, shoes and quickly went off to mount point.

Total Time: 9 min 41 sec. Too long. 

Nutrition: 1 gel + 1 Pain Killer  (no pain, this is an experiment)




### Cycle [90km]
Starting the bike, I was feeling fresh. Bike course was two loop, with one steep climb and decline in each loop. I started to pedal well and watch my power. 

After warming up, I started to overtake people. On the way, I met many friends from Radstrong. The new route was much better than the previous one, with good quality roads. At 13km mark, first climb came. It was surely a tough one. I shifted gears and continued on low rpm / high power, as I've done many times in the training. Soon the reward was there - i reached top of the climb. From there, it was a sharp descent. 

Now this descent was very scary. On this descent, there comes a section where crosswind is strong. Rushing down at 50kmph, I could feel my cycle going out of the control. I've read a lot about this phenomenon - carbon deep wheels struggling in the crosswind. I faced it for the first time and it was shit scary. I went in aero position, putting as much weight as possible on the front wheel. I'm glad to escape this section with no harm. I learnt much later that Rohin had a fall on exactly this place. 

U-turn came at 22.5km mark. I noticed that I was not very comfortable in the aero position. I was going in and out of it. I took a mental note - need to fix this. 

Rest of the bike section was uneventful. First loop came just under 90 min. Second loop downhill was as scary as the first one - I was cursing the deep section wheels. 

In the bike leg, I overtook lot of people (200+, as per the stats - moved from 329 position after swim exit, to 113 position after bike finish). A small vanity advantage of being slower on the swim and fast on the bike :)

Total Time: 2hr 57min  

Nutrition: 75gm carb per hour (2 gel + carb mix), 2 salt tab total, 100mg caffeine per hour. Executed as per the plan.

### T2
T2 was quick - I had one painkiller (Flexon MR) as plan (though it was not really hurting), wore shoes, bib belt, cap and gel.

Total Time: 5 min

Nutrition: 1 gel + 1 painkiller

### Run [21.1km]
Start of the run fell sluggish. There was no pain but fatigue was setting in. And the day was already heating up.

Thanks to all the brick workouts I've done, I could quickly come into a steady rhythm, settling into a pace of 5:30-5:40, which felt just about right, considering the heat that was building up.

Run kilometers were steady and my game plan was clear - stop on all ice station, put ice on my head, tri suit and in ice bandana (ice bandana took a long time to put ice cubes - need a faster strategy next time, or just lose it and train more in the heat)

The incline was sharp and I walked 10-15 steps before resuming the run again. 

Run was overall boring. Last time, Maitreyi and I ran together and chit chatting made the run enjoyable. This time I was running by myself. Tried to keep myself entertained by cheering all fellow athletes - known and unknown. 

During the entire run, struggle was mainly with the heat and building fatigue. Finally, after 2 hours and 12 min, this was done!! Another Ironman 70.3 done and dusted.

End time: 2:12hr

Nutrition: 2 gels per hour + 1 banana  total + lots of ice water

Total Time: 2:12hr

## Post Race
Am I happy with the race? YES! It was a pleasure to race. And meeting all the triathlete friends is a super icing on the cake. 

Am I satisfied with the race - NO! I should have finished this under 6 hours. 

Key Areas I need to improve on:

1. Bike : I got average 140w power and 156w NP. This is very low for Half Ironman race. I should have generated 170-180w (mid Zone 3). Need to continue working on this. Both sustained Z3 work + bike fit needs to be worked.
2. Run : While not complaining on the run result (I got what I trained for), I need to move a gear up in my running capabilities. More smart work I put in, more improvement I am going to see.



Till next race, then!
