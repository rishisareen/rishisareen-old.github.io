### Race Strategy
After [last ironman in 2019](https://rishisareen.com/triathlon/race%20reports/ironman-copenhagen-aug-19-race-report.html), due to Covid triggered halt, it was a long wait of 3 years to race again. 

On my training, I was fairly consistent till end of July. Thanks to Purple Patch coaching, I've improved significantly in cycling. Run was ok, not great as mileage was not there. A good month was 100-120km. Swim was a weak area, as not much swim practice. 

Still I was happy with the fact that consistency was there.

In August, I got Covid. And this time it was bad one. While fever and cough went in few days, intense fatigue lasted entire August. 

My workouts reduced from 8-10 hours per week to barely 2-3 workouts a week. This was a real bummer. I had been training well and this was the peak period of the training. Rather than sharpening, my fitness took a dive. 

This was the time to re-think. It was clear I would not be able to pursue my goal of sub 12. I even considered not going to the race. 

I spoke to few friends to clear my mind. The feedback was clear - I'm fortunate to be able to go and race. I am not a professional athlete, I am in this sport for fitness and fun. So I should let go of all the expectations and just enjoy.

I reached Italy 2 weeks before the race. Those 2 weeks were spent in training, sightseeing the beautiful country and relaxing. Those were most calm 2 weeks I had in last few months.

My race strategy was simple - go out and have fun. No expectation of timing, no self pressure of performance. I, of course, planned to push myself in the race. But I was not chasing a number. 



### Pre-Race - Storm before the Calm
As per planned schedule, Ironman was scheduled for 17th Sept and Ironman 70.3 on 18th Sept.

On 16th Sept, due to warning of big storm the next day, Ironman team decided to postpone the Full Distance Event to 18th Sept. 

And that was a wise decision. On 17th Sept, Rain and Storm arrived at 9am, as predicted. The wind speed was over 80kmph.  There were broken trees and other damages on the road. Finally, it abated at 4pm.

Once storm finished, IM Team worked on logistics to host both 140.6 and 70.3 on 18th Sept. Transition area was extended, new bike racks were added. 

On 17th evening, bike check-in opened at 8pm. Immediately, huge queue of anxious athletes formed. 3000 athletes from Ironman and 3200 athletes from Ironman 70.3 have been waiting anxiously for this.

<Pic here>

At around 9:30 pm, I was able to check-in my bike and rack Bike and Run bag. I filled air in the bike in the night itself. Usually, when racing in hot weather, it is advisable to deflate the tires a bit as bike is out in heat. But as the weather in Cervia (town which was hosting the event) was 20 degree, no risk of tires blowing due to heat.

Reaching hotel, I grabbed dinner and slept by 10:30pm. Tomorrow was going to be a big day.




### Race Morning

The Race Day was finally here.

Race start was 7:30am, with transition area closing at 7am. My plan was to reach there by 6:30am.

At 5:15am, hearing the alarm hum, I woke up fresh. I managed to get a good 6+ hours of sleep. This is very rare - good sleep before the race. As I've detached myself from the result, I was in good place mentally. I was treating the day as long training day and not more than that.

Breakfast was arranged at the hotel itself. I had 2 slices of bread with butter and one banana. 

From hotel, I walked down to the transition area, 700m away. It was a good decision to take hotel close to transition area. No early morning transport arrangements to be done. 

Reaching the transition area, i checked cycle once more. All good, tire pressure was fine, bottles were in their place.

### Swim [3.8km]

Moving out of the transition, I deposited street wear bag (change of clothes + phone) at the registration counter. 

Zipping up wetsuit, I moved to the holding area. After doing an easy warmup, I went to take short dip in the sea. The warm-up sea area was open to the athletes, which is always a good thing. A short dip in the water warms one up and also gives an idea of the water temperature. It was a nice comfortable 21 degree.

Swim was a staggered start, with 7 athletes going in water every 5 seconds. I stood in 90 min queue. Met a fellow Indian/Punjabi Gagan. Chatting with him, we both moved towards the start point. 

Crossing the starting mat, I walked towards the sea. Walked, as sea was shallow for first 100m. Or, so it was supposed to be, as per all practice swims. 

Entering the sea, the water level was suddenly deep. Within 20-30m, my feet started to float in the water. I was absolutely unprepared for this sudden increase in water level. 

Recall that my swim training has been very minimal. On top of that, I do not have much of open water experience. So, somewhere I was anxious and was trying to enter the water calmly. This sudden increase of water level caught me by surprise. My goggles were also not fixed. Due to all this, I panicked and started to swim back towards start line!!!

After few strokes in reverse direction, I reached a place where I could stand again. From this point, starting mat was just 20 steps away. A thought did come to my mind - few more steps and all my panic could end. But I shook this off - I didn't come all the way to here to get a DNF (Did Not Finish).

Some deep breaths, I calmed myself. Seeing a Kayak 200m in the water, I decided to take this as first target and swim till there. By this time, there was hardly any swimmer in sight - all have gone long past. Slowly, I started swimming towards that Kayak. Reaching there, I waved at the guy. He quickly came to me and I wasted no time grabbing the Kayak. First hurdle crossed. From that point, focus was to go from one sighting balloon to other.

All the initial panic costed me 20 min. So, my first 1900m came in 75 min. Way way slower than I would have expected. But still, I was sure I am not going to miss the swim cut-off. There was never a moment of doubt in that. 

As swim progressed, my mind also calmed down and i started to swim with a good rhythm. 

Accelerating in second part, second 1900m came in 42min and I finished swim just under 1 hour 58 min. 

Seeing Mom at finish line was wonderful sight. I waved at her and rushed to T1. 

Total Time: 1hr 58min  
Total Swim done: 3800m (as per my Garmin)

**Nutrition**: 1 gel 15" before the start.

### T1
The transition was a long one and I was still trying to recover from this long swim. I removed wetsuit (came out quickly as I had practiced this several times), wore my tri-top, helmet, gloves, glasses and went running to my bike. It was very disheartening to see that almost all cycles were gone.  

The transition itself was very long, maybe a km or so from the swim exit to bike mount point.

Total Time: 15min

### Cycle [180km]
My stomach was paining from all the sea water and swim struggle. I decided to go easy for first few km, before starting to push.

First 20km were in the city area, all deserted. I settled down on the bike, sipped some water, took first gel. I averaged an easy 27-28kmph speed. I was glad to see my HR came down and settled at 140-145 bpm range.

At 20km mark, the city road merged into a highway. This is where the main race starts. I finally saw other athletes. This gave me a smile and a push. Settling in aero position, I started to cycle at a consistent pace of 32-33 kmph. 

From 20km to 65km, the time flew. There were many athletes on the course - both 140.6 and 70.3 athletes were there. 

Many people were drafting - like big group of 20-30 riders in one peloton. It was crazy. Whenever a big group was crossing me, I would slow down so I don't get drafting penalty (BTW I didn't see a single person getting the penalty in the entire race).

At 65km mark, short climb came. This was about 2km in length and a steep gradient. <Pic of gradient chart> I struggled to go to lower gear and had to stop. Once stopping, it was almost impossible to get up again in the steep incline. So I walked till next flat section. The climb goes for 700m, goes flat for another 500m and then again a climb of 1km or so. At second climb, I was jostled by a big cycling group and I came out again!! Another walk. I wasted so much time in all this.

After reaching the top, downhill was fast and scary. I was continuously on bar with hand on brake. The top speed reached 60kmph :)

Second loop was easy - again same consistent speed of 32-33. The climb again came at 130km mark and this time it was not easy. Covid had really hampered my muscular strength, I struggled big time on hill. Also I was keeping a watch on power generated. On hills, with the lowest gears also I was getting 350-400w. I didn't want to push beyond that and blow my legs up. I ended up walking some part of the hill again!! 

130-180km were breeze - consistent pace again. Good thing is my nutrition was like clockwork , so no energy dip

Total Time: 6hr 06min  

[Strava Link](https://www.strava.com/activities/2632088221)    
Nutrition: 75gm carb per hour (2 gel + gatorade), 1 salt tab per hour, 100mg caffeine per hour. Executed as per the plan

### T2
T2 was quick - I had one painkiller (Flexon) as plan (though it was not really hurting), one gel, applied a liberal dosage of Rash cream (great idea, it helped so much to keep rash away and legs feeling fresh)

Total Time: 9min

Nutrition: 1 gel + 1 painkiller

### Run [42.2km]
From the first km mark, legs felt very good. First km came in 5:40, so I decided to slow up. 

During my last Ironman, I walked a lot during second half of marathon. I was determined not to make the same mistake again. So I decided to run consistent and not too hard, even though I was feeling great. 

Run was 4 loops, with each loop of 10.5km. The entire route is beautiful - it go through the town area and many people were cheering throughout the course. It is a completely flat route. .

After first km, I started run comfortable at 6:30pace, keeping an eye on HR which was steady 135bpm.

In first loop, I met another Indian Sandeep Kothari (recognized my fav running tee brand Athlos on him). He was walking. I tapped him on the back and asked him lets run together. He was doing 70.3 and was on his last loop. We chatted a bit and did the entire loop together. Thanks to the company, first loop was done in 68 min or so. 2 gels taken in this loop + 1/3 banana + dry fruits

Second loop was all alone, energy level was still good. I maintained the pace and finished 21km in 2 hours 26 min. So far, so good. This was the point I took second painkiller, again as a preventive measure. I have never felt this good in an ironman, so I was very happy right now. 2 gels taken in this loop - one caffeinated and one non caffeinated. I tried coke in this loop and felt pukish.

Third loop is where I was cautious. In Copenhagen, I started walking in third loop. Once you start to walk, it is difficult to run again. So here I was focused not to walk. Thankfully, energy level was GREAT. I continued to run and finished third loop at 6:40 pace. 

Somewhere in this loop, my watch gave away (anyone wants to gift me a new watch?). From this point, I was relying on a clock in front of restaurant to calculate the time.

When fourth loop started, I was grinning. Not only I had not walked so far (other than aid stations), I was feeling awesome. I started to push a little now, not too much but again with a confidence that I am heading towards a comfortable finish. 

At 35km mark, I met another Indian (Harshad), with same problem of dead watch. Like a blind man helping another blind man, I told him how much time is left. He was on his third loop and we calculated he has 2.5 hours to finish 12km. He was visibly happy on hearing that.

At 40km mark, I was literally jumping out of joy. I sprinted and did last 2km in 9 min!!  Finally, I reached the read carpet and heard those words again

"From India, Rishi Sareen, you are an Ironman". 

End time: 4:42hr

Nutrition: 2 gels per hour + 1 banana  total + gatorade on and off + water

Total Time: 13:16hr

## Post Race

I was VERY HAPPY with the race. I raced this with no expectation but loved my performance in bike and run. Especially run. I DID NOT WALK the marathon. From last experience of Copenhagen and Kolhapur, this was a huge mental boost. 

Few things went very right - I was well rested before the race, my nutrition was up to the mark and I had good practice in the bike. I also had moved to TT bike. Maybe that can explain why run legs were fresh after the bike.

I  ofcourse need to work on the swim.

Till next race, then!
