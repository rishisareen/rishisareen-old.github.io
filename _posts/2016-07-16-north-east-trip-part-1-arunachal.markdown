All bags packed, we left from Delhi on 7th May. Guwahati was going to be our entry and exit point for this trip.  

Our plan was to spend 6 days in Arunachal Pradesh area, and then come back to Guwahati to meet the parents.

## Day1 : Delhi -> Guwahati

We took IndiGo flight at 10:50AM, and reached Guwahati at 2:50PM (including a halt).

It was raining when we reached Guwahati. First thing I did on reaching Guwahati airport was to go to Arunachal Pradesh counter. 
Now, Arunachal Pradesh is one of the few places in India for which Inner Line Permit is still needed. This can be applied either [online](http://www.arunachalilp.com/), or from few places where ILP on arrival is available. I've read on indiamike that one can easily get ILP from Guwahati airport. So, I went there. It was very smooth, the guy on counter was super helpful. For ILP, we needed to provide address proof, id proof and 2 pics. It took us 30" to get ILP for all of us (all except Ryan, as kids below 5 are exempted.    
We later discovered that kids below 12 are also exempted. But this information was not available on website. So better to have an extra document than less).   
   
From Guwahati Airport, we took uber to Paltan Bazar. This is one of the oldest area, and lot of taxi stands are there for outstation taxis. Plan was to take hotel here for the night, and book taxi for early morning. I opened MMT app, and found a hotel (Hotel Ambreesh, Paltan Bazaar). It was nice basic hotel. It costed me 2500/- for a night with breakfast, dinner and extra bed included.  
After settling, I went to the market to search for a taxi guy. Now, Tawang is typically a 5-6 days trip, as distance is long and bad. I've heard that roads were not good from Dhirang district. With kids, I didn't want it to be a strenous trip, where we are stuck in a car on bad roads for 7-8 hours. Our plan was to go as far as we can, and come back. Idea is to enjoy, not to touch the place for the sake of it. Finally, I found a guy who was willing to go with our random plan, as long as I guarantee to hire him for 5 days atleast. He had a brand new innova. So, we finalized the deal (4500/- per day charges)

## Day2: Guwahati -> Bhalukpong

For Day1, our target was to reach at Bhalukpong, which is end point of Assam. We started around 8AM from hotel. All excited, trip was starting now. Some pics from Day2:

For lunch, we stopped at a place called Nameri Fishing Camp. This was a beautiful place, in middle of jungle. Unfortunately, food was finished there!

Around 4PM, we reached Bhalukpong. We took cottage at Prashanti Lodge (Rs 1700/- for cottage)

## Day3 - Bhalukpong -> Dirang (110km)
TBD
After having a nice breakfast at the lodge, we left for Dirang. The roads starts to go little bad from Bhalukpong, and it was expected to take about 4-5 hours to reach. 
Bhalukpong is one of the entry point for Arunachal Pradesh. So we had to show our ILP here.   
Weather was very nice today, and scenery even more so.

There was a "famous" hot water spring in Dirang. We climbed down there. What a disappointment it was. Having seen hot water geysers in Ladakh, we were expecting something similar. But water was not even lukewarm. Some locals were bathing in there, and it all looked very unhygenic. Surely a waste of time.

There are many solar panels all around North East. It is subsidized by government. A good initiative.
