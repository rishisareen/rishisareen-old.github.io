While running performance is a vast topic, running faster in its most simplistic form is pretty straight-forward

1. Take quicker steps (cadence)
2. Take longer steps (stride length)

## Cadence

In running, cadence is often defined as the total number of steps you take per minute. 

There are many ways you can determine your current running cadence:

1. Count the number of times your left foot hits the ground in 30 seconds then double it to get the total for 60, then double it again to get the total for both feet.
2. Most GPS devices now have a way of monitoring cadence. 

## The Ideal Cadence

While there are many different opinions on cadence, it is generally agreed that somewhere around 170-180spm is the sweet spot for running efficiency and economy. This is the Goldilocks region where your feet are landing in the safest place – neither over- nor under-striding. In this sweet spot, your foot landing is directly in line and below your torso, or just slightly behind it. Cadence varies individually because of differences in height and weight, but if your cadence is too far below or above this range, some problems may start to creep in.



## Stride Length

Runners adjust their stride length to gather speed. Stride length increases as speed increases. One of the most common mistakes novice runners make is over-striding. The most efficient stride length is the natural one – the one that feels most comfortable. By strengthening your leg muscles to take you forward with a longer stride you will improve your performance in and out of races.

To maintain proper stride length, aim to keep your foot strike under your body. When you want to accelerate, avoid the urge to lengthen your stride, and instead quicken your turnover steps.

## How to Improve

There are three ways by which one can increase cadence and stride length in training

1. **Focussed Drill Work**

   The most basic way to teach your body to go quick and correct is to do running drills. Running drills are great in that they exaggerate the motion and thus condition you to feel and understand the movement more intimately.
   
   A couple of times per week, after an easy run — or during a run after you’ve  warmed up — perform cadence and stride length specific drills. Each drill should be performed for 10 to 20 seconds and repeated 2-3 times. 
   
   Some of the drills which are best time investment are :

**2. Use Quick Arms**

Focusing on moving your arms faster can help you take quicker strides  rather than reaching and extending your stride when you speed up. Arms  aren’t weight bearing and thus easier to manipulate. When the arm rhythm changes, legs and feet will follow.

**3. Use Metronome App**

There are many apps available ([RunTempo - iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/run-tempo-runners-metronome/id646414918) , [Metronome Beats - Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andymstone.metronome&hl=en_IN&gl=US)) where you can set a cadence and app will beat at the interval. Try to increase not more than 3-5 beats per week. 

As you develop postural endurance and your body optimizes your mechanics through practice, you’ll be able to maintain that cadence — and speed  — for longer, utilizing the efficient elasticity of your body rather  than having to muscle your way forward.
