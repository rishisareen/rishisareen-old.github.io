### Background 

My journey to the IRONMAN TALLIN 2022 finish line started in the year 2020 when i registered for the race . 

Then Covid 19 played spoilsport and everything came to a halt. I felt like a kid whose exam gets postponed, and he has to keep studying for it till it gets over. After 2 years, the race happened.  

As a result, my outlook towards training underwent 3 major changes :

1. I started enjoying the journey, bothered less about the destination. My training had it's ups and downs - managing Injuries, Family time commitments along with long triathlon training schedules. 
2. I learnt to trust my coach Dr Kaustubh Radkar and his process of training. There were many times I would doubt it asking myself "whether this is sufficient? Whether this will work? " Etc. However over time my only lifeline for training would be coach's training prescription for the day. Wake up in the morning and follow coach's training schedule given for me - that became a norm.
3. I could study better my strengths and limitations and grew confident over time. It's a great feeling when you realize what limits your body and mind can reach, what you can and cannot do, and identify areas where development is possible. 



### Pre-Race Days

#### Arrival in Tallinn, Estonia

After long layovers, 2 consecutive sleepless nights, finally On 3rd August 2am, we reached Tallinn. 

After a brief 4 hour nap, next morning we were out, doing prescribed 4k run along the race course. 

Morning  went in unpacking and completed building/ assembling my bike. From there, we went to Ironman village (which was 2 km from our hotel), did the athlete registration process and visited the expo where I purchased CO2 cartridges (to take on the ride in case of puncture). 

In afternoon, I went for a quick test bike ride just to make sure gears were shifting properly and that everything was in place. That part was satisfactory.

However the following things were troubling me from the time I set foot in Tallinn 

1. **The weather conditions**: The temperature was 18 degrees, it was cold and windy. For the race day, rain was predicted 100% on the race day. Coming from South India's sultry / warm weather, this was worrisome to me.

2. **Fatigue :** The long journey - uncomfortable flights, sleepless nights and layovers took its toll on my legs. My hamstrings, adductors and calf muscles felt crampy and sore. l tried stretching them and felt the soreness increasing. So i decided not to think too much about it, to eat good food, hydrate well through the next couple of days leading up the race with electrolytes and to rest well. 

3. **Messed up Circadian Rhythm:** The sunset happened at around 10 pm and sunrise was at 4 am. The night was only a few hours. This was further messing with my biological clock esp after the long journey and jet lag.

4. **Different Start and End Location:** This was the first race where the start and finish were going to be at different locations. I wasn't sure how the logistics would work out but then that's what being in a group (with the radstrong  gang - Radstrong is coach Dr kaustubh Radkar's training platform) had its perks. The coach gave clear instructions to all of us about all this. So that was put to rest.

On the 3rd evening we had a surprise invitation from the Indian ambassador to Estonia Shri ajaneesh Kumar who invited us to dinner at India house Estonia. It was a moment of pride for all of us (radstrong athletes from India) to be there and interact with him. We clicked Photos next to the Indian flag and the "azadi ka Amrit mahotsav banner". We got back by 10 pm and called it a day.

On next day (4th August), after breakfast,  we went for a short swim at the swim venue (which was the starting point) Lake harku (10 km away from the finish point).
The water was green, murky, cold and without visibility (which I thought was good since clear water would only make it more scary. 
I did a 1 km swim. To my dismay, my right calf muscle cramped up half way into the swim. I managed the cramp and completed the trial swim but then it gave me further worry. Mind plays strange tricks when stressed. Is it the physical exhaustion of the travel, or the extremely cold water which was causing the cramp! What would happen in case of cramp on race day! Well I struggled to put all these fears somewhere in the remote corners of my mind and from that point on, i went into zen mode, not letting negativity affect me. I realise now that this was one of the best things i did. 

The same day i prepared the bike and run bags to be dropped off the next day at the transition points - T1 (transition from swim to bike) and T2 (transition from bike to run)



#### One Day before the race

The next day (the day before the race) was bike check in and transition bag drop off. We  got out of the room by 10 am after breakfast dropped off the bike and the bags, released tire pressure  and could return back only by 4 pm. Exhausting day.

#### Race Morning

Though it's generally said that one doesn't sleep the night before race day, i was happy that I slept by 9 pm, got good 6 hours sleep and woke up fresh at 3 am.

At 4:30am, we left the hotel with the white bag (containing swim gear and street clothes to be worn after finish). A shuttle bus took us to Lake harku. I'll particularly remember this chilly morning where all the athletes were alert, silent and in their own zones. As soon as we reached, i filled air in the bike tyres, attached filled bottles ( one with electrolytes and one with water), Bags with gels and salt capsules on the bike.



### Swim [3.8km]

All done, we went to the start point where we wore the wet suit. **It was the time to start**. Since trial swim wasn't allowed, i did some warm up routines. 

I self seeded myself in the 1.30-1.45 hour swim start group (self seeding is based on the time you expect to finish the 3.8 km swim) and took my first energy gel. In no time i reached the start line and the race was on. 

The water was cold but i kept mind occupied on the next buoy ahead. The problem the mind has to contend with during the swim is that this is the only discipline where you are doing the sport truly alone - you cannot speak to anyone or stop and rest unlike bike and run. Once you start, you can only stop when you reach the finish line.  I kept my mind blank and kept moving from one buoy to the next . Thankfully my sighting was perfect and i did not drift much from the course. Drifting would have meant loss of time and unnecessary tiring out. Though there was a lot of jostling, elbowing and kicking in the water with a thousand odd athletes, I managed to stay safe and keep swimming. In the last 1.5 km the water became very choppy probably due to strong winds or due to the presence of so many athletes swimming together. But there was no option but to swim on and i finally finished the swim. 
Time taken - 1 hour 41 minutes. Part one over. I was happy with the swim and the time.

### T1

By the time i finished the swim and moved into the first transition zone,  it had become quite windy, dark clouds hovered over as if to rain. So after removing wetsuit slipped on helmet bike shorts, rain coat goggles and gloves and off i went. 

Total Time: 7 min

### Bike [180km]

The bike course was 2 loops of 90 km which took us through beautiful villages,  countryside, forests, and pastures. The road condition was average With about 15 km of bad / uneven tarmac.

I started to sip water first 10 minutes. Took my first gel after 15minutes on the bike. And after that it was only Gatorade for the entire ride except little sips of water to wash down the gels. 

My plan was maintain over 25kmph speed and 7 hours total for the bike. But soon weather and brutal headwinds and cross winds turned it into a survival game. 

Though the course is described by many as flat and fast, i never perceived this as either. Climbs were long,  made difficult with head winds. The flats were made scary with cross winds. The wind speed ranged between 25kmph to 40kmph!!!

After just 2km on the bike, it started to rain. The first 100 km, it was raining cats and dogs, it got so cold and after about 15 km i couldn't feel my fingers and toes at all despite fully covered gloves and shoes. The rain coat helped but i felt it was creating a drag and slowing me down further. Nothing else to do but hang in there and keep pedaling. I made sure not to waste time at aid station. Rather than stopping, I grabbed bottles, bananas, bars and gels and saved time there.

From km 101 to 150, everything slowed down -Speed, Time, Thoughts, everything. Though rains stopped, winds got crazy and even downhills were clocking a measly 21-23 kmph. It felt pathetic but i kept going with positive self talks (tried it out for the first time and yes it works!) and taking 5 km at a time. And finally I realized that it was km 180. 

Nutrition - took one gel every 30-35 minutes, one bottle of Gatorade every one hour, one salt capsule every 45-60 minutes. This i followed with military precision. It gave me something to keep my mind occupied and away from the cold, rain and the winds. Despite all of the above, i was happy that I survived ! 

Total Time: 7 hours 15 minutes

### T2

I racked my bike, removed the bike shorts, changes my socks, massaged my feet and toes to get some circulation in (they still felt numb), took a couple of gels and energy bars in my tri suit back pocket and proceeded to the run.

 Time taken - 5 minutes. Happy again ! 

### Run [42.2 km]

It was a 4 loop course of about 10.5 km each. Elevation was about 240 m for the entire course and there was a cobbled run course of about a km in each of the 4 loops.

I walked the first 5 minutes to share out the fatigue and then started a slow run. My target was to keep the pace under 8 minutes per km and finish in 6 hours.  

There were large crowds of local spectators out for cheering which made it great fun to run. Coach had warned us that last 20 km would get physically and mentally tough and instructed to feed energy off other athletes on the run course in the last 2 loops and that was what was exactly happening.

It was only in the last 10 km i realized that I would finish sub 15 hours and that energized me even more. But i was careful not to push myself beyond the speed i allowed myself as I was well aware that if i cramped up, i would end up loosing at least half an hour. I kept bumping into other radstrong athletes and the coach a couple of times. Everyone encouraged each other and i did not feel a low point anytime during the run. The thought of the finish line was drawing me ahead. And suddenly it was time to finish! Nutrition - 1 gel every 45 minutes, one cup of electrolyte from each aid station (every 2-2.5 km), one salt capsule every half hour. 
Time taken - 5 hours 27 minutes. Happy with the time again!

### The finish line 
As I approached the finish line, time came to a stand still, i unfurled the national flag and carried it across the finish line as I heard those magical words being said - Rupesh Suresh, you are an IRONMAN!
Total time taken - 14 hours 40 minutes 45 seconds ! **Yes a sub 15 hour race!**

### Gratitude

There are quite a few people who deserve special mention in this narrative 
1) My coach Dr Kaustubh Radkar for the training plans, without which this level of endurance and confidence to tackle this tough race in such tough weather conditions would not have been possible. The fact that he accompanied us and raced with us was no small measure of reassurance. Which coach does that for his/ her athletes !! And lastly his repeated detailing of the race especially in the last few days, made sure we remember every crucial detail.
   {% include image.html file="/images/20220806_IMTallinn/20220808_IMTallinn_WithKaustubh.jpg" description="One with the coach" %}

2) My wife Suseela who bore the brunt of the stress - of the journey, the race, it's logistics. She ensured that she was a constant presence throughout the race course. From the swim start, swim finish, bike start- finish, throughout the run course and then at the finish line - she made sure she was there for me and that made a huge difference in my energy levels. I couldn't have done this race without her by my side.

3) My dear friend and Ironman Rishi Sareen (Delhi) who first introduced me to my coach a couple of years ago - my nutrition and hydration was spot on thanks to him. He made me go through my nutrition strategy over and over again, sent me notes, checklists and above all lifted me up at low times. Always ready with a solution to any problem. Love you brother.

4) My friend Govinda pai (3 times IRONMAN) residing in the US, who kept ensuring i was in the right frame of mind especially in the last few weeks, constantly sending me reminders and important tips for race day. It added up to how I performed on race day! 
   {% include image.html file="/images/20220806_IMTallinn/GovindaPai.jpg" description="Govinda Pai" %} 

5) My dear friends from athletico de Alleppey - who trained with me for years, who on certain days would train with me just because my training schedule was such, who pushed Me, egged me on, endured me, kept ensuring that all was well, tracked my progress, encouraged and inspired me all the way to the finish line. These are my brothers who bond over sports without boundaries.

6) Last but not the least - my dear and close family and non athlete friends who despite not sharing my same enthusiasm and  passion for triathlon, still go out of their way to keep track of it for my sake and provide huge huge encouragement at various levels and times. The mere thought of these people during the race would send bolts of energy boosters when the going was low.!
