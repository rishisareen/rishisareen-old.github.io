For those who are not aware, Podcasts are episodes of a program available on the Internet. They are similar to radio program, but they are audio files, and one can downlad and listen to them at their convenience. iOS and Android devices have podcast apps available for this purpose. 

For podcast listeners, podcasts are a way to enjoy great content from around the world for free. For podcast publishers, podcasts are a great way to reach a wide audience.
One can find podcasts for broad ranging topics - business, startup, sports, health, self-development, culture, history, ...the list goes on. 

I've been hooked on Podcasts for half a decade now. After books, this is my most preferred medium to acquire knowledge on any topic. 
I usually listen to podcast during my commute - 1:5 hours of total commute gives enough time to listen to one episode, and get some good knowledge. 

Here is the list of my top 5 favorite podcasts: 
<!--more-->

1. [**The Tim Ferris Show**](https://tim.blog/podcast/): For anyone who is into life hacking, Tim Ferriss is THE GURU. The Tim Ferriss Show is generally the #1 business podcast on all of Apple Podcasts. 

    This is the Tim's description about his podcast:  
    "Each episode, I deconstruct world-class performers from eclectic areas (investing, sports, business, art, etc.) to extract the tactics, tools, and routines you can use.  This includes favorite books, morning routines, exercise habits, time-management tricks, and much more."  
    
    Each episode varies from 45" to 2hours sometime. Tim is a master interviewer, and though interviews are of long duration, they are value for the time. I've listened to almost 200 podcasts from Tim, some of them multiple times. I can't recommend this guy enough. If you listen to just one podcast, listen to Tim.  
    
    Particulary the episides with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Scott Adams, Tony Robbins, Peter Thiel were very good. I've learnt so many things from the guests on the podcast.  
    
    After listening to Terry Laughlin's podcast on Tim's Show, I implemented his techniques, and learnt swimming (**at age 38!!!**). And that is just one example! Go, listen now.  

2. [**The Joe Rogan Experience**](http://podcasts.joerogan.net/) : Second to Tim, Joe is another master interviewer and does the long format interview. He was a standup comedian, MMA expert. His interview list is again wide ranging - comedians, actors, MMA fighters, authors and more. His interview with Wim Hoff and Sam Harris were particularly brilliant. 

3. [**Purple Patch Fitness**](https://purplepatchfitness.com/education/podcasts): This podcast is mostly geared towards triathlon, though his episodes on nutrition and hydration are useful to anyone who is active in sports. 
Matt Dixon has coached more podium finisher triathletes than any other coach. He has a no-nonsense, cut to the chase approach to the triathlon training. Each single episode is just outstanding. 

4. [**Ben Greenfield Podcast**](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/): Ben Greenfield is the ultimate biohacker. His website says: "In 2013 and 2014, Ben was named as one of the world’s top 100 most influential people in health and fitness, and by 2015, Ben was coaching the world’s top CEO’s, chefs, biohackers, poker players, tennis, motocross and endurance competitors, and professional athletes from the UFC, the NHL, the NBA, the NFL and beyond – all while advising and investing in top companies in the health, fitness and nutrition industry.". Ben is a treasure hove for anyone who wants to get a bit more fit.

5. [**Primal Endurance**](https://primalendurance.libsyn.com/): This is hosted by Brad Kearns - another top former athlete. This podcast focus on healthy eating, rest, recovery. Most of my nutrition philosophy comes from Primal Endurance. Very logical, very strightforward.


The podcast world, just like the book world, is a very vast world. Internet has completely changed the content creation, and many leaders are using blogs and podcast method to reach out to audience and like minded people. The above list is from my favorite genre - Lifestyle management, and fitness. Hopefully this will give you some pointers to dip your toes. 

Happy listening!
