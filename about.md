Hello!

Rishi means an accomplished and enlightened person. Hey, don’t look at me, I didn’t choose my name.

This is my personal blog. I write about my ideas, learnings, travel reports, and lately a lot about sports.  

I'm a geek at heart, and I like to continuously push myself out of my comfort zone.  

Since childhood, I've been obsessed with reading. I started with fiction - Jeffrey Archer, PG Wodehouse, Sherlock Holmes, Classic Novels - the list is endless. I used to have books in all corners of house.  
Lately my interest has shifted to non fiction. I'm obsessed with science of habit forming, and reading a lot on it these days. I also love to read on science behind sports performance. 

Triathlons are something which is a major part of my life currently. It started as a bucket list item, and has grown into a full blown passion. You'll find lot about triathlon on my blog.  

I've built this website using Jekyll/Hydeout.  I like the simplicity offered by static website - no frills, just plain text and images. For VPS, I use Github Pages..  

I like to connect with like minded people. If you want to connect, and discuss about anything, drop me a note.   

You can reach to me at rishi at rishisareen dot com.
